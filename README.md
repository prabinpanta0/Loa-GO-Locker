# Loa File Locking Script

## Introduction

`loa.py` is a Python script designed to securely lock and unlock files within a specified folder using password-based encryption. It leverages the `cryptography` library to encrypt files, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential. This script is particularly useful for users who need to protect files temporarily or prevent unauthorized access.

## Features

- **Password Protection**: Encrypt and decrypt files using a user-provided password.
- **Hidden Encryption Key**: Stores the encryption key in a hidden directory to enhance security.
- **Folder Structure Preservation**: Maintains the original folder structure during encryption and decryption.
- **Single Binary File Storage**: Combines all encrypted files into a single binary file for efficient storage.
- **Automated Process**: Automatically detects whether to lock or unlock files based on the presence of specific files.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **Cryptography Library**: Install the required library by running:

  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```

## Folder and File Naming Conventions

- **`loa.py`**: The main script responsible for encrypting and decrypting files. Its name is kept simple and self-explanatory, indicating its purpose (lock/unlock files).
- **`.key/` Directory**: This hidden directory contains the encryption key (`key.key`), encrypted password (`password.txt`), and folder structure (`structure.enc`). It is vital for the decryption process.

  - **`.key/key.key`**: Stores the symmetric encryption key used for encrypting and decrypting files.
  - **`.key/password.txt`**: Contains the encrypted password provided by the user.
  - **`.key/structure.enc`**: Stores the encrypted folder structure, ensuring files are restored to their original state during decryption.
- **`Locked/` Folder**: A temporary folder created during the encryption process that holds the files before they are combined into a binary file.
- **`Locked.bin`**: The binary file that contains all encrypted files from the folder. It is stored inside the `.key` directory after encryption.
- **`README.md`**: This file is generated during the locking process, providing instructions and notices to users. It is used as an indicator for the lock state and contains specific guidelines.

### Naming Logic:

- Names such as `.key`, `Locked`, and `Locked.bin` follow a descriptive convention, indicating their roles in the locking/unlocking process. The use of a hidden `.key` folder emphasizes its critical and confidential nature, reducing the risk of accidental deletion.

## Usage

1. **Locking Files**

   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing `loa.py`.
   - Run the script:

     ```bash
     python loa.py
     ```
   - Since the files are not yet locked, the script will prompt:

     ```
     Enter a password to lock the files:
     ```
   - Enter a strong password and press Enter. The script will:

     - Generate an encryption key and store it in a hidden `.key` directory.
     - Encrypt all files within the `luames` folder.
     - Combine encrypted files into a `Locked.bin` file and store it in the `.key` directory.
     - Save the encrypted folder structure.
     - Create a `README.md` file with instructions.
2. **Unlocking Files**

   - Run the script again:

     ```bash
     python loa.py
     ```
   - The script detects that the files are locked and prompts:

     ```
     Enter the password to unlock the files:
     ```
   - Enter the password used during the locking process. The script will:

     - Decrypt the `Locked.bin` file and reconstruct the original folder and files.
     - Verify the password. If correct, it restores the files; if not, it notifies you of the incorrect password.
     - Clean up by deleting the `.key` directory and `README.md` file.

## Key Functions

### `generate_key()`

- This function generates a new encryption key using the `Fernet` symmetric encryption algorithm. The key is stored in the hidden `.key` directory. If the directory already exists, the function avoids generating a new key.

### `load_key()`

- This function loads the encryption key from the `.key/key.key` file, essential for encrypting or decrypting files. If the key is missing, it raises an error.

### `encrypt_file(filename, key)`

- Encrypts the contents of the specified file using the provided key. The encrypted data overwrites the original file.

### `decrypt_file(filename, key)`

- Decrypts the specified encrypted file using the key. The decrypted data overwrites the encrypted file. If the decryption fails, an error message is returned.

### `folder_to_file(folder)`

- Combines all the files in a folder into a single binary file (`Locked.bin`), preserving the folder structure. The encrypted folder structure is stored in `.key/structure.enc`.

### `file_to_folder(file)`

- Reverses the `folder_to_file()` function, extracting individual files from the binary file and recreating the original folder structure.

### `lock_files(folder, password)`

- Encrypts all files in the given folder, moves them into a "Locked" directory, and stores the encrypted binary file in `.key`.

### `unlock_files(folder, password)`

- Decrypts and restores the original files from the "Locked" binary file, given the correct password.

## Notes

- **Do Not Delete `.key` Directory**: The `.key` directory contains the encryption key, password, and folder structure needed to unlock your files. Deleting this directory will result in irreversible data loss.
- **Secure Your Password**: Losing the password used during the locking process will prevent you from unlocking the files. The password is stored in encrypted form inside `.key/password.txt`, and the correct password is required for decryption.
- **Do Not Modify `README.md`**: This file serves as an indicator of whether the files are locked or unlocked. Altering or deleting this file may interfere with the scriptâ€™s functionality.

## Security Considerations

- **Hidden Files**: The script uses hidden directories and files (`.key`) to store sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords.
- **Encryption**: Files are encrypted using `Fernet`, a symmetric encryption method from the `cryptography` library, which is widely recognized for secure encryption.
